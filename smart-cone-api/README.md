The smart-cone-api is a service which will run on the starting cone. It is named 
smart cone in that is has additional functionality compared to every other cone,
and provides control over the entire field. Some example functionality might be:
- GetAllCones
- PlayerStart(id)
- SetupPlayers
- GetResults

etc. This service is going to be fairly broad, so expect this readme to be expanded
quite liberally as the code advances.
