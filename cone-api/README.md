The cone-api folder is where the code for the cone service will be stored.

The cone-service is implemented in node.js using express as a router and
socket.io for dynamic event sending.

The cone-api will provide cone-local functionality and events. For example,
the REST api will provide informational and action-oriented commands/queries like:
- GetInfo
- ConeTriggered
- SetTime

etc.

This readme will expand as the cone api is fleshed out.
