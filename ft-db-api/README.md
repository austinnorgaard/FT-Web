The ft-db-api will provide a service which wraps a database (not decided yet)
which the smart-cone-api and field-trainer website will use to either create, retrieve
update or delete persistent information. This includes transient scoring information, session results
and possibly longer-term results (until they have synced somewhere more permanent).

This readme will expand as the code is written for this area.
